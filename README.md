# Demo Calendar Api - Sotatek

Hi guys. This is a demo for Google Calendar API using NodeJs. I tried with both client side and server side. Unfortunately, we need to make it from server side.

### Step 1: Clone this demo
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Sotatek-HieuVu/demo-calendar-sotatek.git
```

### Step 2: Generate node_modules/
```bash
$ npm install
```
or
```bash
$ yarn install
```
### Step 3: Run project
```bash
$ npm run start
```
or
```bash
$ yarn start
```
and you should see the result from terminal
